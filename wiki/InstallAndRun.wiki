= Introduction =

D-Box is a Java program, which means it runs on many different platforms. We currently only ship D-Box in Java's own JAR format, and have currently not used any time to make it run more like a native application (i.e. exe file on Windows).

But don't worry, it's still super easy to use, execute and install!


= How to install =

What you need:
  * A computer (duh...)
  * Java 5.0 or better (sometimes called Java 1.5)
  * Native DosBox binaries (found here: http://i1.no/06wt)
  * Some kind of unzipper (built in in most operating systems)

What to do:
  * Download the newest D-Box
  * Unzip the archive into a nice folder (i.e. C:\games\dbox on Windows)
  * Double-click on dbox.jar
  * Follow the instructions on the screen


= Troubleshooting =
  * To check if you have the right java version, type "java -version" in your command line
    # Good enough Java (1.5, 1.6, 5.0, 6.0)? Move on...
    # Old Java (1.3,1.4)? Go to java.com and download

  * Windows tell me that dbox.jar is an archive, and want to extract it!
    # Jar is actually a zipped file, but it is structured in a special way that makes it able to "run" like a native application. If your operating system tries to extract the file, try one of the following methods:
    # Right click on the file and select "open as.." and then "Jar Launcher" (or something similar)
    # Open your favorite terminal (Start > Run > type "cmd", on Windows), navigate to the dbox directory and type java -jar dbox.jar
