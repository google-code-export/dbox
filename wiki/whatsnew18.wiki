_This is about a future version of D-Box. The current version is 1.7_

  * *Drag & drop support!* Simply drag the main file into the gamelist, and D-Box will set up the rest (i.e. find setup files and icons)
  * Added a small empty border around the objects in the game list
  * Folder icon instead of "Browse..." text in dialogs
  * Better size on Preferences dialog
  * Possible to mark a game as a favorite
  * Human readable gamelist (note: you need to migrate from D-Box 1.7 to 1.8, if not you will have to add all your games once more)
  * Filter games by genre (you can edit available genres in the config file)
  * New meta information tab in "edit game" dialog: Add searchable keywords and genres
  * New switches:
    * -config configuration file - _uses the configuration file instead of the standard "dbox.config"_
    * -gamefile game-list file - _uses the game-list file instead of the standard "gamelist.dat"_
    * -version - _prints the current D-Box version_
