= About the source code =

D-Box is completely open source, which means that you can take the source code and modify it. I created D-Box using [http://netbeans.org Netbeans 7], so I recommend everybody to use the same tool if you want to start hacking.

If you make any useful changes, please contact me! (i.e. add a comment on this page)
